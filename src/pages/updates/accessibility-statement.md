## The standard we adhere to

Tacoma Porchfest strives to be Web Content Accessibility Guidelines 2.1 (WCAG) AA compliant. The WCAG is an open standard for determining accessibility. AA compliance is considered good support for a website geared towards a global audience.

## Accessibility features

In addition to semantic HTML, these features are set up specifically to work with assistive technology:

- Distinct, descriptive page titles.
- Ordered headings to construct a logical document flow.
- Landmark areas to describe overall sections of the page.
- Unique, descriptive names for links, buttons, and other interactive controls.
- Skiplinks have been placed to help people navigate past content that repeats from page to page.
- Alternative descriptions for non-text content.
- Titles for content embedded via `iframe` elements.
- Removing repetitive, redundant links to the same destination from the Accessibility Tree.
- Small amounts of ARIA to help address gaps in assistive technology support.
